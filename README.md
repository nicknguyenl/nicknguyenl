Hello! I am currently a senior undergraduate Computer Science (CS) major with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence at Kennesaw State University. I am on track to graduate this December and plan to pursue a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. 

I am determined to expand my knowledge and skill sets in computer science as well as the several branches of Artificial Intelligence including Machine Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning.

- Iâ€™m currently working on three projects, pinned to my profile
